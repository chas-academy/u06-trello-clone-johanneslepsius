# u06-trello-clone-johanneslepsius

The goal is to create a simple web app (to understand jQuery) with functionality to
* drag and drop hardcoded cards between three or more columns (todo, doing, done)
* click on cards to see their contained info
* the info is divided into tabs
* you can select a deadline

**Currently i am working on functionality to allow users to create new cards**
