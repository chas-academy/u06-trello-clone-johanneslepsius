# u06-trello-clone-johanneslepsius

**this is in no way a trello clone, and was not meant to. it is simply the name of the assignment**

The goal was to create a simple web app (to understand jQuery) with functionality to
* drag and drop hardcoded cards between three or more columns (todo, doing, done)
* choose if you want a review board
* click on cards to see their contained info
* the info is divided into tabs
* you can select a deadline
* let user create new cards, which are saved in localStorage
* own jquery widget, in my case the annoying mode: if you activate it and drag a task, it will jump uncontrollably from place to place. Quite educational!
