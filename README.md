# u06-trello-clone-johanneslepsius

The goal was to create a simple web app (to understand jQuery) with functionality to
* drag and drop hardcoded cards between three or more columns (todo, doing, done)
* choose if you want a review board
* click on cards to see their contained info
* the info is divided into tabs
* you can select a deadline
* let user create new cards
* own jquery widget, in my case the annoying mode: if you drop a task card on a board column, 
  it will place it in a random position as soon as you let go of it.

**lesson: donÂ´t use tailwind CSS just because you can**
